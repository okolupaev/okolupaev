## Hi there 👋

<!--
**okolupaev/okolupaev** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- aspire to start using non-GUI computational tools for flow cytometry data analysis
- I have limited coding experience (a summer grad school Python bootcamp) 
- I am hoping to streamline my data processing/analysis workflow and reduce dependence on commercial packages
